      <p>"During new years eve 150 illegal immigrants tryed to cross the san diego border." now this is not really about those illegal immmigrants as this is really nothing new. This is more about how "MSN", "The CW", "MSNBC" and "CNN" all call them migrants now these people are not migrants. A migrant is someone who moves from one part of a country to the other a immigrant is someone who movesfrom one country to another while an illegal immigrant is someone who moves from one country to the other illgeally, This is a trick the left try to use by saying that these people belong here. well they dont if they wont to come here they can do it legally like millions do a year. call them what they are Illegal immigrants.</p>
